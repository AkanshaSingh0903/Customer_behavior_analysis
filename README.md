# Customer_behavior_analysis - Data Analytics Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior across multiple product categories to identify trends based on age group and gender. The goal was to answer management-driven business questions, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

The analysis combines SQL for querying and KPI calculation, Python for data cleaning and EDA, and Power BI for visualization, followed by a concise business report and presentation.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer purchase transactions across various product categories, including clothing, footwear, and accessories.

Key attributes include:

Product category (e.g., Shoes, Dresses, Jackets, Handbags, T-shirts)

Customer gender

Customer age group

Purchase quantity / sales metrics

The data was cleaned and prepared before analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas) – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Answering management questions and deriving KPIs

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma – Business presentation (PPT)

GitHub – Version control and project documentation
